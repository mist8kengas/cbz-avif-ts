Working proof-of-concept AVIF Comicbook Zip archive converter

Rust version can be found [here](https://github.com/mist8kengas/cbz-avif)[^1]

[^1]: Rust version is not fully implemented due to `dav1d` compilation errors. Hence why I created a JavaScript version that uses [sharp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp).
